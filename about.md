I am a pragmatic Cloud Engineer that gets excited by solutions that can stand the test of time and have real world impact. I believe that solutions should be reliable, manageable and secure and have a healthy allergy to over-engineering.

Others would describe me as social and adaptable. I believe that teams perform at their best when everyone feels safe, there is a shared vision and the leadership is not afraid to be vulnerable. I prefer to work in flexible agile processes.
